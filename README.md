# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 

The purpose of this analysis is to build and evaluate different machine leanring models and apply them to solve the credit card risk. Then we need to compare the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models, and make a recommendation on the model to use.  

The machine learning algorithms used in this analysis were:

* RandomOverSampler Model

* SMOTE Model

* ClusterCentroids Model

* SMOTEENN Model

* BalancedRandomForestCalssifier Model

* EasyEnsembleCalssifier Model



## Results: Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. 

### RandomOverSampler Model

### SMOTE Model

### ClusterCentroids Model

### SMOTEENN Model

### BalancedRandomForestCalssifier Model

### EasyEnsembleCalssifier Model


## Summary: Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
